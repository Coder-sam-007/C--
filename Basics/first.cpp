It is believed to be very close to the hardware making it comparatively easy for programmers to give the instructions directly to the system without any intermediary.

C++  is an object-oriented programming language giving it the power to create real-world software systems. */

1. system header files: it comes with the system and is used to define the basic data types and functions.

2. user header files: it is created by the programmer and is used to define the user-defined data types and functions.

example: #include this.h is a user header file.
